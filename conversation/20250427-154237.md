## Generate Strategy

#### System Prompt

```
You are a quantitative finance assistant. Your task is to analyze the user's finance-related question.

Instructions:
- Do NOT generate a full strategy or code yet, although in the end of all steps I should get
  1. code to test my strategy
  2. strategy itself: strategy_type, assets, lookback_days, indicators, evaluation_metrics, and next_steps.
- Break the problem down into a step-by-step decision-making plan.
- For each step, explain the reasoning.
- Output strictly in JSON format.

Example Output:
```json

  "prompt": "Design a high-frequency trading strategy for the NASDAQ 100 index futures, focusing on short-term mean-reversion within a 5-minute timeframe.",
  "strategy": [

      "justification": "Use indicators sensitive to short-term price deviations, such as Z-Score of mid-price returns, VWAP deviations, or fast RSI (e.g., 2-period RSI)."
    },
    {
      "action": "Define evaluation metrics",
      "justification": "Metrics such as Profit per Trade, Sharpe Ratio (intraday), and Maximum Drawdown are critical for HFT performance evaluation."

### Step 0 Define the asset class

#### System Prompt

```
You are a quantitative trading assistant helping to build a strategy.

User's original question:
Identify small market cap biotech assets for potential investment opportunities.

Steps completed so far:

Common Errors to Avoid:
- Error: 'Adj Close'
  Cause: yfinance may return data without an 'Adj Close' column, or the column might be labeled 'Close'.
  Fix: After downloading data, check and rename columns: data.rename(columns={'Close': 'Adj Close'}, inplace=True)
- Error: TypeError: Argument 'real' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got DataFrame)
  Cause: TA-Lib functions expect NumPy arrays, not pandas Series or DataFrames.
  Fix: Use .values to convert: talib.SMA(data['Adj Close'].values, ...). Optionally fill NaN with .fillna(method='ffill').

### Step 4 Evaluate risk factors

#### System Prompt

```
You are a quantitative trading assistant helping to build a strategy.

User's original question:
Identify small market cap biotech assets for potential investment opportunities.

Steps completed so far:
Step 0 Define the asset class
Focus on biotech stocks, which belong to the healthcare sector and are known for high volatility and growth potential.

Step 1 Determine market cap criteria
Identify small-cap stocks, typically defined as companies with a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion.

Step 2 Source potential assets
Use financial databases, stock screeners, or indices like the Russell 2000, which includes small-cap stocks, to find biotech companies within the desired market cap range.

Step 3 Consider additional filters
Apply additional criteria such as liquidity, recent performance, and news sentiment to refine the list of potential investment targets.

Common Errors to Avoid:
- Error: 'Adj Close'
  Cause: yfinance may return data without an 'Adj Close' column, or the column might be labeled 'Close'.
  Fix: After downloading data, check and rename columns: data.rename(columns={'Close': 'Adj Close'}, inplace=True)
- Error: TypeError: Argument 'real' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got DataFrame)
  Cause: TA-Lib functions expect NumPy arrays, not pandas Series or DataFrames.
  Fix: Use .values to convert: talib.SMA(data['Adj Close'].values, ...). Optionally fill NaN with .fillna(method='ffill').
