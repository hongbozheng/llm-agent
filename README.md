# LLM-Powered Quant Developer Assistant

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is a fully autonomous AI-powered Quant Developer Assistant. It
enables usersâ€”such as retail investors, quant researchers, and finance
studentsâ€”to generate, execute, and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies by
simply asking natural language questions.

> Example:
> **"What's a good momentum strategy for TSLA over the past 3 months?"**

The system returns a step-by-step strategy plan, generates code, executes it,
performs backtests on historical data, and outputs a full evaluation summary.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### âœ… GPT-Orchestrated Strategy Planning
- LLM generates a JSON plan detailing asset, indicators, timeframe, evaluation
- metrics, and task sequence

### âœ… Code Generation & Automated Execution
- Each step is translated into Python code and auto-executed
- Failures trigger a threaded auto-fix system with up to 3 retries

### âœ… Strategy Evaluation & Backtesting
- Historical stock data is used for realistic backtesting
- Calculates Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Annualized Return, Win Rate, and more

## ðŸ§± Technology Stack

- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT-4o, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini Pro
- **Backend**: Python, Pandas
- **Execution Engine**: `exec()` with error recovery + retry logic
- **Data**: Yahoo Finance API
- **Frontend (optional)**: Flask

```
## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Create virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv hft
```

### Install dependencies

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Generate + Execute Strategy Plan

``` python
python3 src/main.py -m <llm> -p <prompt> -f <file_path> 
```

- `<llm>` - LLM to use (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini, Deepseek, etc)
- `<prompt>` - prompt to generate a strategy plan for
- `<file_path>` - generated strategy plan file path

Example command line inputs.
```
python3 main.py -m gpt-4o -p What's a good strategy for NVDA in the next 30 days?
```

```
python3 main.py -m gpt-4o -f strategy/strategy_gpt-4o_What's_a_good_strategy_for_NVDA_in_the_next_30_days_20250425_172847.json
