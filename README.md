# LLM-Powered Quant Developer Assistant

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is a fully autonomous AI-powered Quant Developer Assistant. It enables usersâ€”such as retail investors, quant researchers, and finance studentsâ€”to generate, execute, and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies by simply asking natural language questions.

> Example:
> **"What's a good momentum strategy for TSLA over the past 3 months?"**

The system returns a step-by-step strategy plan, generates code, executes it, performs backtests on historical data, and outputs a full evaluation summary.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### âœ… GPT-Orchestrated Strategy Planning
- LLM generates a JSON plan detailing asset, indicators, timeframe, evaluation metrics, and task sequence

### âœ… Code Generation & Automated Execution
- Each step is translated into Python code and auto-executed
- Failures trigger a threaded auto-fix system with up to 3 retries

### âœ… Strategy Evaluation & Backtesting
- Historical stock data is used for realistic backtesting
- Calculates Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Annualized Return, Win Rate, and more

## ðŸ§± Technology Stack

- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT-4o, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini Pro
- **Backend**: Python, Pandas
- **Execution Engine**: `exec()` with error recovery + retry logic
- **Data**: Yahoo Finance API
- **Frontend (optional)**: Flask
